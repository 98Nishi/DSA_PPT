/*
Q1: 2022 Convert 1D Array Into 2D Array
You are given a 0-indexed 1-dimensional (1D) integer array original, and two integers, m and n. You are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2D) array with Â m rows and n columns using all the elements from original.

The elements from indices 0 to n - 1 (inclusive) of original should form the first row of the constructed 2D array, the elements from indices n to 2 * n - 1 (inclusive) should form the second row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.

Return an m x n 2D array constructed according to the above procedure, or an empty 2D array if it is impossible.

Example 1:
Input: original = [1,2,3,4], m = 2, n = 2
Output: [[1,2],[3,4]]

Explanation: The constructed 2D array should contain 2 rows and 2 columns.
The first group of n=2 elements in original, [1,2], becomes the first row in the constructed 2D array.
The second group of n=2 elements in original, [3,4], becomes the second row in the constructed 2D array. */

var construct2DArray = function (original, m, n) {
  // Check if the total number of elements in original is equal to m * n
  if (original.length !== m * n) return [];

  let result = [];
  let arr = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < original.length; i++) {
    arr.push(original[i]); // Push the current element to arr

    // If the length of arr reaches n, a row is complete
    if (arr.length === n) {
      // Push arr into the result array
      result.push(arr);
      arr = [];
    }
  }

  return result; 
};
const original = [1,2,3,4];
const m = 2;
const n = 2;
const constructedArr = construct2DArray(original,m,n);
console.log(constructedArr); // Output [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ]
